### Details | Comments
Albeit this project was made coding along while following the related course, a few changes have been made from the original project.

**Firefox**: From version 53: by default, the modal feature (used to reset all the tasks) is not enabled. It is hidden behind the dom.dialog_element.enabled preference (needs to be set to true). To change preferences in Firefox, visit about:config.
